1. Matrix - this is a simple python script that creates a matrix like effect using ASCII. R,G,B,Y will change the colors
2. Matrix3 - this is a python script that creates a matrix like effect using ASCII and NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttc . R,G,B,Y will change the colors, 1-9 will change the intensity and it also include a speed and volume control
