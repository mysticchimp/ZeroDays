# ZeroDays

This repo contains my early Early learnings in python. I'm having fun understanding how it works and what is possible, which is in turn producing new ideas I want to test out. 

1. EmotionDetect - this is a computer vision app that is able to detect basic facial expression (happy, sad, neutral, anger, fear). It records the expressions and saves the output as a txt file and provides a summary on your mood. 
2. Matrix - this is a simple python script that creates a matrix like effect using ASCII. R,G,B,Y will change the colors
3. Matrix3 - this is a python script that creates a matrix like effect using ASCII and NotoSansCJK-Regular.ttc . R,G,B,Y will change the colors, 1-9 will change the intensity and it also include a speed and volume control
